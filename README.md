# landing-page
Landing page project only in HTML e CSS for improve my skill. 

- I learned and experimented a lot with HTML layout and Flexbox with CSS.
- I used only vanilla HTML and CSS.
- I better understood how Flexbox and Flexwrap work. I had a lot of fun using some of my own flair and style to create this landing page.
- I will come back to improve the project by adding more pages and other features as I learn more things along the way.
